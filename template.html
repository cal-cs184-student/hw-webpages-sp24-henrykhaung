        </div>

        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented the function `rasterize_triangle` so
            that we can render a triangle to screen space given 3 points in (x,
            y) coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            I solved this task by checking for triangle winding, finding the
            bounding box to sample the pixels in, and checking whether each
            pixel passes the three line test, which was covered in lecture.
            First, to make sure the vectors representing the edges of the
            triangle are counter-clockwise, I used the right hand rule and the
            cross-product. The sign of the cross-product indicates the winding
            direction and in my case, since I want the winding to be in
            counterclockwise, I check if the cross-product sign is negative
            (indicating counterclock wise) and if it is I swap the position of
            vertices ie x becomes y and y becomes x. This is to ensure
            counter-clockwise winding for the three line test. Once this is
            taken care of, I found the boundaries of the given vertices: the
            smallest x and y and the biggest x and y. This is so that I can
            sample points within this bounding box without having to start from
            (0,0) and ending at (w,h) of screen space. Using this bounding box,
            I iterate through each point and for each point, I find sample
            points by adding 0.5 to x and y. Then, I perform the three line test
            and if the test passes, I call `fill_pixel` helper function to set
            the color of a pixel. Since this algorithm tests each pixel in the
            bounding box, it is no worse than one that checks each sample within
            the bounding box of the triangle.

          <h3>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented supersampling to get rid of the
            "jaggies" that we saw from task 1. In other words, we antialiase by
            supersampling.
          </p>

          <p>
            To support supersampling, I had to modify set_sample_rate,
            set_framebuffer_target, resolve_to_framebuffer, rasterize_triangle,
            and add a helper function called fill_supersample_pixel.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              `set_sample_rate`
              <p>
                This function is called when we want to change the supersample
                rate or when we press = during the runtime of the draw program.
                The only change needed here to support supersampling is to
                ensure that when the sample buffer is resized, it is resized to
                a size of width * height * rate where width and height are the
                dimensions for the frame buffer while rate is the sample rate.
                This calculation is needed to support the increased number of
                samples.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `set_framebuffer_target`
              <p>
                This function is called when the draw program window is resized.
                When the program window is resized, we have to resize the sample
                buffer as well and to support supersampling, the sample rate is
                accounted for in the resize calculation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `rasterize_triangle`
              <p>
                Since supersampling is sampling multiple points within each
                pixel and averaging them, we need to modify this function to
                have nested for loops in order to iterate over each pixel inside
                the bounding box. Then, we test these subpixels with the three
                line test again and if they are within the triangle, we color
                them using `fill_supersample_pixel`.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `fill_supersample_pixel`
              <p>
                This is a helper function I added. This functions similarly to
                the `fill_pixel` function except it supports supersampling; the
                function makes it so that all the supersampled pixels, or
                subpixels, correspond to the pixel in the frame buffer and are
                changed to the same color. In order to do this, I need to change
                the way I index into the sample buffer. This is done by
                accounting for sample rate and keeping track of the sample
                within the pixel (x, y). This means that I take in one extra
                parameter which I call `s` and we keep track of it inside the
                inner loops for the subpixels.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I used the sample_buffer and resized it by doing width * height *
            sample_rate so that there is enough memory for the subpixels. I also
            modified the rasterize_triangle function to have two for loops
            inside the loops for iteration through the pixels. These two inner
            loops are for iteration through the subpixels; within them, I find
            the sample point for each subpixel. Then, I perform the 3 point test
            and if it passes, I call on fill_supersample_pixel to fill the
            subpixel with the specified color. I also keep track of the index of
            the current subpixel so that in fill_supersample_pixel, I can index
            into the correct sample_buffer. The function resolve_to_framebuffer
            is also modified by taking our subpixels and averaging them down.

          As supersampling rate increases, the triangle edges are smoother. This
          is because supersampling is essentially taking a higher resolution and
          then downsampling and averaging it to the output resolution of the
          frame buffer.
